# Is there a connection between Islam and violence?

[Explore](http://mr-chanakya.github.io/islam_and_violence/) the data visually to find out for yourself.

# Details

It would be inappropriate for *me* to answer that question directly with a yes or no answer. Many people have tried to answer this question through various justifications and I found each of the answers unsatisfactory. So, I won't try to do that. Here, I have combined two kinds of data which might help you to reach a conclusion to the question.

1. Muslim Population Percentage per country (source: Pew Research Center)
2. Global Peace Ranking per country 

I have created a page for you to [explore](http://mr-chanakya.github.io/islam_and_violence/) the above two data sources and reach your own conclusions.
